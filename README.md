# CFA $R_t$ postprocesing

⚠️ This is a work in progress

## Overview

Code to transform the ouptus of an $R_t$ model run into a standard set plots and
tables for internal evaluation or publication.

### Inputs
This pipeline inputs $R_t$ estimates generated by an upstream model.
The estimates can come from any model, as long as they are formatted following
CFA's standard [schema for $R_t$ estimates]https://github.com/CDCgov/cfa-epinow2-pipeline?tab=readme-ov-file#directories).

```

### Outputs
The cfa-rt-postprocessing pipeilne generates figures and data tables for
internal evalution and for publication to the [CDC website](), to
[data.cdc.gov](), and to [DCIPHER](). By convention, the pipeline always
generates outputs for publication, even if the input data is from an experiment,
test run, or backfill exercise that is not intended for release. The publication
outputs are not costly to generate and our person-driven releae process ensures
that outputs are only released after approval and publication by the team.

- `<root-subdir>/`: The base output directory for processed runs. This could
contain info on the dataset and model (for production runs), or on the
experiment goals (for test runs).
- `<release-name>/`: A subdirectory named to communicate the group of jobs
being processed, e.g. covid and flu jobs for the same run date.
By internal convention this is usually the date the model was run in production,
or for backfill runs, the date of the data snapshot fed into the model.
- `internal_review/` a subdirectory holding outputs for internal review. Outputs
in this subdirectory are job specific. These outputs are generated upstream of
the release outputs, and may contain values that are witheld from release after
review of the models and data, or data that are not released publicly.
- `merged.csv`: A table that summarizes the results of a job and can
be used to generate all downstream plots and publication outputs. Because this
table is designed to support plotting it is in wide format with columns:

  - `release_name`, `task_id`, `geo_value`, `disease`, `model`
  - `reference_date`, `run_date` (date model was run, or as-of date of the data snapshot passed to the model), `final_datapoint` (final date available in the data passed to the model)
  - `rt_median`, `rt_lower`, `rt_upper` (median and 95% crediible intervals for Rt, estimated)
  - `expected_obs_cases_median`, `expected_obs_cases_lower`, `expected_obs_cases_upper` (latent real-time data values, estimated)
  - `pp_nowcast_median`, `pp_nowcast_lower`, `pp_nowcast_upper` (median and 95% posterior prediction interval for nowcasted final data values, estimated)
  - `data_value` (data value reported on `date` in the snapshot available as of `run_date`)
  - `p_growing` (fraction of the Rt credible interval above 1), `category` (Growing, Likely Growing, etc. as defined on the [CDC Rt page](https://www.cdc.gov/cfa-modeling-and-forecasting/rt-estimates/index.html)) - these are NA for all dates except `final_datapoint` and reflect the probabilities and trend categories that would be reported for this run in the map released on the website.

-`plots/` a single choropleth and lineinterval plot for all jurisdictions, and a
location-specific timeseries plot for each jurisdiction
- `release/` a subdirectory holding data files formatted for public release.
- `merged_release.csv` a single long table containing all fields shared
publicly, for all diseases in the same release. Created by binding `merged.csv`
for each disease into a single table, selecting reported fields, and dropping
data excluded after manual review. Contains the fields:  `location` (renamed from `geo_value`), `disease`, `release_date` (??), `rt_median`, `rt_lower`, `rt_upper`, `p_growing`, and `category`
- `..._map_data.csv`, `...timeseries_data.csv` derived from merged_release. We
need to keep producing these until we can make front end changes.
